These talking machines
are going to ruin the
artistic development of
music in this country.

When I was a boy . . .
in front of every house
in the summer evenings
you would find young
people together singing
the songs of the day or
the old songs.

To-day you hear these
*infernal machines* going
night and day.

We will not have a
vocal chord left. The
vocal chords will be
eliminated by a process
of evolution, as was
the tail of man when he
came from the ape.
